Neural network chess engine developed as a part of my dissertation.

### Abstract
Reinforcement learning is one of the most rapidly developing areas of Artiﬁcial Intelligence. The goal of this project is to analyse, implement and try to improve on AlphaZero architecture presented by Google DeepMind team. To achieve this I explore diﬀerent architectures and methods of training neural networks as well as techniques used for development of chess engines
